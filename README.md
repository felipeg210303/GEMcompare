# B. subtilis FBA

Here we are going to develop a repository of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) available for *Bacillus subtilis* which are reviewed and well documented. We are also going to include some use cases and examples for each model and compare the results obtained between models with the computational tool of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) performed in python using the library "cobrapy" based in COnstraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) and with experimental data.

Objectives of this repository: 

	*To make genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of Bacillus subtilis easily accesible and comprehensible in one single place even for people with low programming skills and allow them to make hypothesis with the use of this models and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).

	*To elaborate a in silico experimental protocol for the use of genome-scale metabolico models (GEMs) of *Bacillus subtilis*.

	*To compare some of the available GEMs of *Bacillus subtilis* using the proposed protocol as pipeline.

You can find the tutorials and documentation for the use of this repository in the following Jupyter Notebooks: <>

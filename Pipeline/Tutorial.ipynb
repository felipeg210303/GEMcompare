    "The first step in the pipeline is to collect the model files. This step must be performed manually. It involves downloading the model files from available model databases, such as BiGG Models and BioModels. These databases usually contain the most curated and widely used models; however, more recent or specialized models may not yet be included there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, model files are often provided in the supplementary material of research articles or in a GitHub repository referenced in the data availability section. If neither of these options is available, it is recommended to contact the authors directly to request the model files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all models are collected, you must ensure that they are stored in the correct format. In this repository, models are expected to be in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format, which uses the .xml extension. The suggested versions are SBML Level 3 Version 1 (SBML3v1) or SBML Level 3 Version 2 (SBML3v2) with the FBC (Flux Balance Constraints) package enabled.\n",

    "The curated Bacillus subtilis models should be placed in the models/ folder of this repository.\n",

    "- [SBML Converter](https://www.sbml.org/sbml-simulator/) for converting SBML files to other formats.\n",
